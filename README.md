# OpenRice

[Heroku Link](https://openrice.herokuapp.com/#/)

OpenRice is an OpenTable clone. OpenTable is an online restaurant-reservation service company founded by Chuck Templeton on 2 July 1998 and is based in San Francisco, California. The clone incorporates a Ruby on Rails backend with PostgreSQL database and a React/Redux frontend.

# Features & Implementation 

The app's two target audiences are Customers and Restaurant Owners. Therefore, I have created two classes of users to fullfill their needs in isolation.
